                <h2>Director's Message</h2>
                <p>I am happy to take this opportunity to introduce you to the University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET), an in-campus Engineering Institute situated in the heart of Panjab University, Chandigarh. Since its establishment, UIET has come a long way and is geared towards rapid growth. This is possible because highly competitive students are selected through an all-India entrance test, research-oriented faculty, and an infrastructure that is most suited to learning. Apart from focusing on academics, the institute also lays emphasis on the soft skills of students to prepare them for the professional world.

                    Networking with leading organizations and institutes has greatly benefited the institute hugely in orienting students to R&D activities as per the requirements of industry. Corporate sector has been very forthcoming in assessing UIET students. As a result majority of our students are placed through campus placements. I strongly feel that the industry can benefit from the tremendous potential that UIET has and can further collaborate in creating an industry-academic interface. I extend an invitation to the corporate sector to participate in the Campus Recruitment Program of UIET.</p>
